<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm André</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate developer from São Paulo, SP, Brazil</h3>

I work as a Fullstack Software Engineer, mostly using React.js, Next.js, Node.js and Typescript. Previously worked professionally with Ruby and Ruby on Rails too. I also used C, Java, Python and Haskell in some University projects. Wanting to learn a new backend language, probably Go, and mayber other functional programming language like Elixir. But my main focus always will be creating amazing projects, regardless of the tool.
